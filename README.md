# ZalandoHoloLens
The Project was created during the Hackathon 2017 at the TGZ Aachen.

# Project Description:
In order to support the sorting in stocks, Zalandos challanged us to create an Application for Microsofts HoloLens.
The problem was, according to the limited time, reduced to a 4x5 bottle crate.

# Our Implementation:
When you start our Application you can see a "Holo Crate". When you click that "Holo Crate", it will fall to the ground. The real crate musst be placed, where the holo one dropped to the ground.
A random slot of the crate will light up (using a box, which stands inside the slot) and indicate, in which slot the next bottle should be put. After putting the bottle inside, you can acknowledge the insertion by clicking the box, that lighted up. You can repeat that, as often as there are free slots in the crate.
